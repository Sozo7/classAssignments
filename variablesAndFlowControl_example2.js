CHALLENGE 2
(10 minutes)

Create a variable for the temperature and set it to 80
Write a statement that outputs the temperature as "The temperature is 80 degrees";
If the temp is greater than 80, output "time to swim" (set temp to 60, 90) and test;
Create a precipitation variable and set it to false
Only output "time to swim" if temp is greater than 80 and its not raining
Set the precipitation variable to 'raining' or 'snowing' and only output 'time to swim' if there is no precipitation
Create an 'indoors' variable and set it to true
If indoors, then output 'time to swim' regardless of the temp and precip.

const temperature = 80;    // first condition create variable and set it to 80
console.log("The temperature is 80 degrees") //second condition statement that produces output
if (temperature > 80){
    console.log("time to swim")
}
const precipitation === false; //setting a variable for precipitation to false
if (precipitation === raining ||snowing){ //i really do not understand what the condition is asking.  my thinking is to make an if else statement where if raining and snowing conditions are not met then move forward with the next.
    console.log("time to swim")
}
const indoors = true; //setting indoors to true
console.log("the temperature is" +temp +"degrees");
